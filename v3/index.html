		<h1>CS 1501: Tools of the Trade (Web)</h1>
		<aside>This is a student-taught class for Fall 2017. It's taught by Srikanth Chelluri and Nikhil Gupta.</aside>

		<br>

		<h3>Course description</h3>
		<p>
			This course is intended to teach first and second-year students common computer science practices which are normally accrued after taking higher-level coding classes, engaging with lots of coding projects, and working at robust software engineering companies. The primary goal is to make students feel comfortable tackling large projects because by the end of the semester, they’ll have similar insights as someone with more experience.
		</p>
		<p>
			We are going to focus primarily on building web applications, but a lot of the concepts we talk about can apply to building any kind of project. We’ll delve into things like getting the most out of Git, using package managers, following accepted industry practices, developing solid APIs, using the shell effectively, designing an app’s frontend, and general project deployment, scaling, and management.
		</p>
		<p>
			This class is very heavily lecture-based. We expect students to come to every class. Additionally, we will have a demo project that is synced with our lectures (and make public all its source code). Although it’s not required, we encourage students to either follow along with this demo project or build a unique project themselves (individually or with a team) as we discuss the relevant concepts in class. We might have small reading assignments or tasks throughout the semester.
