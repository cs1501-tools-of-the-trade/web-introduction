# web-introduction

This repository contains demo code for web languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Note that none of the content here actually matters - it's just placeholder.

The repository has three folders: `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`:
- `v1`: A purely static HTML-only page. There is no CSS for styling and no JavaScript for client-side logic. No modern website is remotely similar to this, but it's a good starting point before adding complexity.
- `v2`: This is **exactly** the same HTML page as `v1`, except it has a reference to a custom CSS stylesheet. That lets us customize the look of the site. In the rawest sense, this is how you add styles to any modern site.
- `v3`: We added some very basic JavaScript to the site. This lets us do some logic on the client itself - it's pretty powerful. You add JavaScript in a way similar to how you add stylesheets/CSS.
